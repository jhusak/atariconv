Introduction
------------

This application is intended to allow Atari Basic programs to be converted
from tokenised binary format back into regular ASCII. Other options include
the ability to display the variable name table as well as reconstruct one
if it has been deleted.

Documentation for Atari Basic and Atari system in general can be found at:

De Re Atari - A Guide to Effective Programming
http://www.atariarchives.org/dere/

The use of tokenised BASIC allowed for programs to be stored compactly in the limited
memory of 8-bit system (64K with 3 byte CPU instructions and 8K of display memory) as
well as saved out to disc or tape. 


Build instructions
------------------

In the directory where the source code is contained, simply type the command

	make

This will compile the source code into the executable atariconv


Running instructions
--------------------

Enter the directory 'src' and run the command 'atariconv'. The -h command
line option will display all the options available.
